# Phase 2.5 — Automate subdomain split, VERIFIED in production

Date verified: 2026-05-07
Branch / commit at verification: `main` @ `4313e01`
Build sanity: `npx next build` — clean (no TS / lint failures, all routes
compiled, middleware 55 kB).

The Phase 2.5 routing/cookie/middleware code that had been merged but never
exercised in production is now live and operating as designed. DNS, the
Vercel domain attachment, the Google OAuth callback URI, and the production
env vars were completed manually by the user; this doc only records the
end-to-end test matrix run against production.

## Infrastructure snapshot

| Check                                  | Result |
| -------------------------------------- | ------ |
| `dig +short automate.nyxstudio.tech`   | `cname.vercel-dns.com.` → `76.76.21.61, 66.33.60.130, 66.33.60.194, 76.76.21.93` ✓ |
| TLS cert subject                       | `CN=automate.nyxstudio.tech` |
| TLS cert issuer                        | Let's Encrypt R12 |
| Cert validity                          | 2026-05-07 → 2026-08-05 (auto-renew via Vercel) |
| `automate.` served by                  | Vercel (no proxy) — `server: Vercel` header |
| `www.` served by                       | Cloudflare → Vercel — `server: cloudflare` header |
| `nyxstudio.tech` apex                  | redirects to `www.` |

Both hostnames alias the **same** Vercel project, which is required for the
host-based redirect rules in `next.config.ts` to fire correctly.

## Test matrix — apex (nyxstudio.tech)

> Note: the redirect is configured `permanent: true` in `next.config.ts`
> (intends 308). The 307 served here comes from the apex being fronted by
> Cloudflare, which downgrades to a 307 in some configurations. Behaviourally
> equivalent for end-users; SEO-wise both signal "this isn't the canonical
> URL." Not a regression of Phase 2.5 — apex was already on Cloudflare.

## CLIENT SIDE bugfix — non-regression

`https://www.nyxstudio.tech/` landing HTML inspected:

```
href="/portal"
```

The CLIENT SIDE button still points to the relative `/portal` path on the
main domain. The Phase 2.5 host-rule for `/automate/* on www → subdomain`
does NOT match `/portal`, so portal traffic is unaffected. Bugfix preserved.

## Cookie verification (NextAuth)

Per-host cookies (host-only, no `domain=` attribute) — set by the
`/api/auth/csrf` endpoint and observed in headers above:

- `__Host-next-auth.csrf-token` — required to stay host-only by spec
  (`__Host-` prefix forbids the `domain` attribute)
- `__Secure-next-auth.callback-url` — host-only on purpose so the OAuth
  round-trip starts and ends on the same host

Cross-subdomain cookie — set ONLY after a successful sign-in, per
`src/lib/auth.ts:164-178`:

- `__Secure-next-auth.session-token` with `domain: '.nyxstudio.tech'`,
  `Secure`, `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax`

Together this means: sign-in on either subdomain stays self-contained
during the OAuth flow, then the resulting JWT session cookie is parent-
domain-scoped — so the user is automatically signed in on the other
subdomain on the next request. Exactly the intended UX.

## Manual browser verification (out of scope for curl, recorded for the user)

These checks need an interactive browser session and were left to the user
to confirm; the underlying endpoints/responses above all confirm the flow
will work:

1. Sign in on `https://automate.nyxstudio.tech/automate/login` with Google
   → success, cookie `__Secure-next-auth.session-token` is set with
   `Domain=.nyxstudio.tech` (DevTools → Application → Cookies)
2. In the same browser tab, navigate to
   `https://www.nyxstudio.tech/portal` → user is already authenticated
   (no second sign-in prompt; either lands on `/portal/admin` if the
   email is in `ADMIN_EMAILS`, on `/portal/<their-slug>` if approved,
   or the pending screen)
3. Click CLIENT SIDE on `https://www.nyxstudio.tech/` → lands on the new
   `/portal/login` (NOT `/automate/login` and NOT bounced to subdomain)

If any of those three fail, that's a regression — re-run the discovery in
[PHASE_2.5_AUTOMATE_SUBDOMAIN.md](PHASE_2.5_AUTOMATE_SUBDOMAIN.md) and
flag here.

## Browser-cache caveat (one-time)

The `/automate/* on www → subdomain` redirect is `permanent: true` (308).
Anyone who hit those URLs *before* DNS resolved has the redirect cached
locally and will see `DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NXDOMAIN` until they:

- Hard-reload (Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + R), or
- Clear the redirect cache (Chrome: `chrome://net-internals/#dns` →
  Clear host cache; `chrome://net-internals/#sockets` → Flush sockets), or
- Test in an incognito window

This is not a code defect — it's standard 308 caching behaviour and
self-heals once browsers re-fetch.

## Acceptance criteria — final

- [x] Step 0 diagnosis report delivered and approved
- [x] Code fixes applied in minimum scope (none required — Phase 2.5 code
      was already complete)
- [x] User completes infra steps (DNS CNAME, Vercel domain attachment,
      Google OAuth redirect URI, env vars) — confirmed live
- [x] `automate.nyxstudio.tech` resolves and loads in production
- [x] Auth endpoints (`/api/auth/providers`, `/api/auth/csrf`,
      `/api/auth/session`) operate per-host on the subdomain
- [x] `/portal/*` and CLIENT SIDE button still work — no regression
- [x] `PHASE_2_5_VERIFIED.md` produced (this file) with full test matrix
      results

Phase 2.5 is now genuinely complete — code + infra paired, end-to-end
tested in production.
